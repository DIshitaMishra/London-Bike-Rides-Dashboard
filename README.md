# London-Bike-Rides-Dashboard

Hey everyone,

Excited to share my project, the "London Bike Rides Dashboard"! 🚴‍♂️📊

I explored how things like weather, time, temperature, and wind speed impact bike rides in London. Used Pandas for data cleanup and exploration, then created a neat dataset that I saved to Excel.

The fun part? Building a cool, interactive dashboard with Tableau! 🚀 Learned to make heat maps, added visual charts in tooltips (fancy, right?), and even created a moving line chart.

Super stoked about what I learned in Tableau during this project. Can't wait to show you all the cool insights I found!
